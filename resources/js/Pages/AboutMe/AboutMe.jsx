                    My name is Marco and my passion is developing software and
                    help others through technology. I started my journey in this
                    industry in 2021, being a passionated about technology, I
                    decided to switch my career and become a developer.
                    Initially, I was a self-taught developer, but I realized
                    that I needed more knowledge. Therefore, I made the choise
                    to enroll in the university to understand the basics of
                    computer systems.
                    <br />
                    I quickly felt in love with the programming world. The fact
                    that you can create something from nothing is amazing. I
                    love the blend of creativity and logic that programming has.
                    <br />I focussed on the web development, because I believed
                    it was the best way to start and show my skills to others.
                    In order to improve my development skills, I have been
                    learning a lot and doing everything I can to archieve my
                    goals <br />
                    After 6 months of hard work, I received an amazing
                    oportunity at&nbsp;

                    &nbsp;as a junior developer. I'm very thankful to them to
                    giving me the chance to demonstrate my skills and learn from
                    them. Initially it wasn't easy, because the company it's
                    very small and everyone required to do everything, from
                    communicating with clients to doing front-end work, managig
                    the database, deploying into production, testing new
                    features, and more. I lacked of knowledge in many concepts
                    required for the job, but I had the determination to learn
                    and do my best. <br />
                    <br />
                    The learning experience was immense, but now I choose it's
                    time to move on, I would like to take the next step in my
                    career and continue growing. <br />
                    That's why I'm currently looking for a new challenge to
                    further my growth and learning. I'm seeking an international
                    team, new technologies, and new projects. <br />
                    Over the past 2 years I've been focusing on my comunications
                    skills, improving my English everyday to be the best I can
                    be. <br />
                    In my current company I've been involved in many projects so
                    i'm able to switch from one to other without any
                    difficulties. My day to day tasks include communicating with
                    the clients, making changes in the database, adjusting the
                    front-end, developing new features required by clients, and
                    many others. <br />
                    I have no problem adapting myself to new technologies or
                    projects, but if given the choise, I would prefer to work
                    with the ones I already know and master them. <br />
